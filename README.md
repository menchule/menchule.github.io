## My Website

Personal website and living portfolio.

This repository hosts my personal website, where I bring together the different domains that define my professional and creative path:  
**product leadership in digital health and biotech, specialty coffee entrepreneurship, and music.**

It is not a static CV, but an evolving space to connect disciplines, projects, and ideas — and to leave room for what comes next.

## What you’ll find here

- **Product & biotech**  
  Experience in digital health, molecular imaging, and medical devices, with a focus on product strategy, launches, and business impact.

- **Specialty coffee**  
  Entrepreneurship, operations, and community-building as co-owner of a specialty coffee shop in Madrid — applying product thinking to hospitality.

- **Music**  
  A parallel career as a double bass player, shaping how I think about collaboration, discipline, and collective performance.

- **Travel & culture**  
  International curiosity as a driver for perspective, adaptability, and cross-cultural work.

## Why this project exists

I believe the most interesting work happens at the intersection of disciplines.  
This website is a place to explore those intersections — science and business, craft and systems, structure and creativity.

It also serves as a lightweight, human alternative to a traditional portfolio.
## Roadmap / Next ideas

While my background is rooted in biotech, digital health, and regulated environments, I am deliberately deepening my understanding of how modern software products are conceived, built, and scaled — beyond managing them.

### Bridging biotech and software

Biotech has strong scientific rigor but often lags behind in software culture, tooling, and product thinking.  
Software-native companies, on the other hand, move fast but rarely operate under the constraints of regulated, high-stakes domains.

My focus is on bridging these two worlds:
- Applying modern software product practices to biotech and digital health
- Translating regulatory, scientific, and clinical complexity into usable, scalable software products
- Learning from software-first ecosystems to raise the bar in traditionally conservative industries

### Hands-on software learning

Alongside product leadership, I am actively strengthening my technical foundations:
- Returning to **programming with intent**, not just literacy
- Exploring **Python** for data, automation, and product prototyping
- Learning **Kotlin** to better understand modern backend and system design
- Studying how software products are structured: architecture, trade-offs, and long-term maintainability

The goal is not to become a full-time engineer, but to be a **software-fluent product leader** who can think, decide, and communicate across disciplines.

### Beyond work

I also believe that learning systems extend beyond screens:
- **Kitesurfing** — reading conditions, risk, and flow
- **Inline skating** — balance, repetition, incremental progress
- **Sauna & cold exposure** — resilience, recovery, and mental clarity

These practices reinforce the same principles I value in product work: awareness, adaptability, and long-term consistency.

- Plain HTML & CSS
- No frameworks, intentionally simple
- Designed for clarity, longevity, and easy iteration

## Status

This is a living project.  
Content, structure, and sections evolve as my work and interests do.
